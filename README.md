# Instructions 
Welcome to your first HTML coding challenge.

In every assignment in frontend:

You will be able to read the instructions in a similar markdown file.
You will have to edit the main.html (for html), styles.css(for css, later) & script.js(for javascript, later) files.
Do you see the code in your main.htmlfile that says <h1>Hello</h1>? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this: <h1>

Closing tags look like this: </h1>

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag. To pass the test on this challenge, change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World" in the main.html file.
